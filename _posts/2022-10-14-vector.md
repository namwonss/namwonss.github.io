# Scalar definition
A scalar is a mathematical object with only magnitude.

# Vector definition
A vector is a mathematical object with magnitude and direction.

On the $\mathit{x}$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the intuitive notion of length of the vector is defined by

$\mathbf{\boldsymbol{x}}=[x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}]^T$.
