In computer science, an **object** is a component of programs, which have related **states** and **behavior**.

<br/>

For example, in real world, human has states $(age, name)$ and behavior $(speaking, sleeping, eating)$. In addition, the car has states $(speed, gear)$ and behavior $(brake, accelerator)$.

<br/>

An object stores the states of software in fields and exposes the behavior of software to methods.
