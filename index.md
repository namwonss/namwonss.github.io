**About me**

<br/>

Hello, I'm Namwon Kim.

<br/>

I'm currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree (advised by [<font color='dodgerblue'> Prof. Chang-Sung Jeong </font>](https://koreauniv.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/chang-sung-jeong)) in the [<font color='dodgerblue'> Department of Electrical Engineering </font>](https://ee.korea.ac.kr/eng/main/main.html) at the [<font color='dodgerblue'> Korea University</font>](https://www.korea.edu/), Seoul, Republic of Korea.

<br/>

My research interests include:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Distributed Parallel Computing.

<br/><br/>

I always go for **intuitive** and **deep** thinking.

<br/>

I try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of **value**.

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
